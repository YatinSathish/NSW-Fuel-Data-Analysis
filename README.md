# NSW-Fuel-Data-Analysis
An analysis of fuel price data from the NSW FuelCheck dataset, focusing on fuel price trends across different regions in New South Wales (NSW).
## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Data Cleanup & Transformation: The dataset goes through a thorough cleaning process to fix missing values and combine relevant information, like fuel prices and postcodes.
- Fuel Price Comparison: The analysis compares fuel prices in urban vs. rural areas to see how they differ across the state.
- Visuals: There are interactive graphs and box plots that show fuel price trends at independent vs. franchised stations and how prices vary between urban and rural regions.
- Key Insights: The project highlights where rural areas face higher fuel prices, especially for LPG, and sheds light on how fuel prices fluctuate in different parts of the state.
## Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub for managing and sharing the project
This project is all about understanding how fuel prices differ across NSW, and it shows how we can use data to spot patterns and gain insights into everyday life.
